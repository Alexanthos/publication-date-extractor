# Publication Date Extractor

University project by Hanna Brinkmann, Zofia Milczarek, Alexandre Nechab, Joanna Radola

The aim of this project is to propose a pipline that determines the publication date of a given document. 

## Approach
We use a Llama 3.2-Instruct 8B Model in 4bit quantization that was fine-tuned on the date extraction task to determine the publication date. The model output has consistently the following format: {"publication date": "DD/MM/YYYY"}. For our test data set we computed the accuracy for perfect matches, mont and year matches and only year matches: 

|Match              |Accuracy|
|-------------------|-------:|
|Day, Month and year|71%     |
| Month and Year    |  82%   |
| Year              | 93%    |

Before setteling on this approach, we tried different, not fine-tuned models. The code can still be found above.

## Data

Our corpus consisted of 500 official documents created by cities, municipalities and courts. For each document we manually annotated the publication date to have a gold standard. As not all documents were accessible, we excluded those with invalid URL. We then performed a 70/30 split in order to obtain a train and a test set. The model was fine-tuned with the first and last 3000 characters of each document in the train set.
